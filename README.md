# Features
- Handles missing values and performs feature scaling for improved accuracy.
- uses a heatmap to find the correlation amond the features.
- Uses ML techniques such as XGBoost.
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like Mean absolute error and R squared error.
- Visualizes the actual values and predicted values using a scatter plot to see how they are related, whether they have a close relationship.
